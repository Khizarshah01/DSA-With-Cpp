# Pointer
- Pointers are one of the most important aspects of C++. Pointers are another type of variable in CPP, and these variables store addresses of other variables.
- While creating a pointer variable, we need to mention the type of data whose address is stored in the pointer. e.g., to create a pointer that stores the address of an integer, we need to write:
 int* p; 
-  This means that p will contain the address of an integer. So, if a pointer is going to store the address of datatype X, it will be declared like this:
 int* p;
 # Address Operater (&)
- While creating a pointer variable, we need to mention the type of data whose address is stored in the pointer. e.g., to create a pointer that stores the address of an integer, we need to write: int* p; This means that p will contain the address of an integer. So, if a pointer is going to store the address of datatype X, it will be declared like this: int* p;
Example - cout << (&var) << endl;
